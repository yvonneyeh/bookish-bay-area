### Why Books? Why Bay Area?
I developed this project at [Hackbright Academy](http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/) for my solo capstone project. I’m a voracious reader and every year, I set a goal to read at least 52 books per year. Every time I encounter a reference to my hometown or somewhere nearby, I get super excited! I grew up in the Silicon Valley and I love exploring the area –– what better way to explore during a global pandemic than through literature? 

My project incorporates everything I’ve learned about full-stack web development in the first 6 weeks of my software engineering fellowship at Hackbright. I started with little to no experience in computer science before this.
